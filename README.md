Building the Smart Nation
The Smart Nation movement went from conceptualization to real action. The ZEA
(CZ2006/CE2006 Authority) launched its fourth Data-Driven Smart Nation Competition in
January 2017. The goal ofthe competition is to elicit innovative applications that exploit
the publicly available government data (https://data.gov.sg/ ) to change the ways we live,
learn and work.
You can find a list of applications that were developed using the government on the website
https://data.gov.sg/. However, the number of ways to use the data to make our nation
smarter is only limited by your imagination!
The competition will last 11 weeks. The milestones are described below.  
• At the end of the 2nd week, the ZEA wants to see proposals of applications with
clear target users, application features, and market values. Your application must not
be a simple presentation of data extracted from these databases. Instead, it should
have some clear benefits to users. The ZEA will veto any proposal that is not
considered sufficiently challenging for the team to develop. As there are many
tourist and weather-oriented application in the market, the ZEA will veto any
applications whose major features are tourist or weather-oriented, unless the ZEA is
convinced with your new ideas.  
• At the end of the 4th week, the ZEA wants to see a complete proposal of application
functionalities and user scenarios. To determine whether the teams have technical
skills to develop the proposed application, the ZEA also wants to see an initial design
of the application.  
• At the end of the 9th week, the ZEA wants to see the complete system architecture,
system design, and the initial application prototype.  
• At the end of the 11th week, the ZEA will invite all the participating teams to
demonstrate their working application prototype to other teamsin the same class.  
Any application proposals are welcome! However, the participating teams are required
to use government data APIs or other data APIs for real world data. The teams must obtain
access to the data API through the government agency websites or other authorized data
sources. Using more types of government data APIs or even other publicly available data APIs
(e.g., Google Maps) is allowed.  
The applications should be web applications deployed in a cloud platform. The training and
usage of the cloud platform will be provided for free. The applications will be judged by the
innovative use of data as well as the quality of the milestone deliverables described in the
Lab Manuals and the rigorous process that the teams follow through the competition.
